### SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS.
- Create a function speedDetector and provide a parameter which will accept the driver's car speed as an argument.
- Create two variables(speedLimit and demeritPoints).The first variable stores the driver's car speed while the second variable stores the demerit points awarded if the sped limit is exceed.
- Using conditional statements such as if..,else if... and else.Provide conditions that have to be fulfilled in ordered for a return to be excuted.Example: if(speed<=speedLimit){
    return "Ok"};
- After steps 1,2,3 invoke the function and input your argument to see the function in action.
